## Notes/ToDo

* Look into fade effect for the lower parts of the front page mini articles
* Hover effect on pic links on index is odd on mobile

[ ] copy header nav to all pages
  [x] home
  [x] about
  [x] contact
  [x] ca
  [x] nz
  [x] usa
  [x] studyingAbroad
[x] make active link in small header noticeable
[x] add full page for why study abroad
[ ] content for above full page
[ ] add 'captions' to other homepage images (see NZ)
[ ] footer with social links
[ ] form!
[ ] db
[ ] format images
[ ] hover/links on home location images and headers - fix responsiveness of text

## It looks like we will need an AIP to send the emails

### ToDos and Notes for the API/Mail Service

* Plain HTML/CSS/JS/Jquery cannot send mail, it can only provide a mailto link - this will only open a user's mail service and allow them to send a free form email. It fails if the settings on your device don't have a default mail service, and it will not allow us to gather the information we want or (possibly) send a from reply email.
* Because of the above, I will build out a nodeJS service that will run separately to handle parsing form input and sending out an email. (An API)
* Current plan is to NodeMailer and heroku.
