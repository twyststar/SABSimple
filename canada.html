    With one of the longest coastlines, vast wilderness, world-class cities, and a culture of tolerance and diversity,
    Canada is a natural destination for thousands of international students.

    <img class="smallIcon" src="./images/cap1.png" alt="icon of graduation cap">
    <p class="pb-3">
    One of the biggest reasons students choose to come to Canada is the quality of a Canadian education. A Canadian degree
    is widely recognized as equal to one from the United States, Australia, or the United Kingdom.

    <img class="smallIcon" src="./images/shield1.png" alt="icon of lotus type flower">
    <p class="pb-3">
    Canada is one of the safest countries in the world, with a low crime rate. In terms of social progress and development,
    according to Global News, Canada was ranked the second country in the world with the highest quality of life.</p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="./images/snow1.png" alt="icon of lotus type flower">

    In Canada, students can pleasantly combine an enriching academic life with diverse and entertaining leisure activities.
