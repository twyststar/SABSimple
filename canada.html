    With one of the longest coastlines, vast wilderness, world-class cities, and a culture of tolerance and diversity,
    Canada is a natural destination for thousands of international students.
    </p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="./images/cap1.png" alt="icon of graduation cap">
    <p class="pb-3">
    One of the biggest reasons students choose to come to Canada is the quality of a Canadian education. A Canadian degree
    is widely recognized as equal to one from the United States, Australia, or the United Kingdom.
    </p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="./images/shield1.png" alt="icon of lotus type flower">
    <p class="pb-3">
    Canada is one of the safest countries in the world, with a low crime rate. In terms of social progress and development,
    according to Global News, Canada was ranked the second country in the world with the highest quality of life.</p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="./images/snow1.png" alt="icon of lotus type flower">
    <p class="pb-3">
    In Canada, students can pleasantly combine an enriching academic life with diverse and entertaining leisure activities.

    <p class="pb-3">
    English and French are both official languages in Canada and share equal status, but anywhere you choose to go in
    Canada, you can easily survive just by speaking and communicating in English.</p>

                Our schools are located in cities and rural communities throughout the province's three francophone school districts.
                They offer high quality academic programs in a safe environment aimed at helping participants to learn or improve French
                language skills.
            </em></p>
            <p><em>
                Participants are carefully matched with a francophone host family, with whom they can experience first-hand, the warm
                hospitality and rich cultural history of the Acadians. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It includes fascinating
                activities for every season. By the end of your stay, you will be able to converse comfortably in French, and will have
                made lasting friendships.
