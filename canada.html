    One of the biggest reasons students choose to come to Canada is the quality of a Canadian education. A Canadian degree
    is widely recognized as equal to one from the United States, Australia, or the United Kingdom.

    Canada is one of the safest countries in the world, with a low crime rate. In terms of social progress and development,
    according to Global News, Canada was ranked the second country in the world with the highest quality of life.</p>
