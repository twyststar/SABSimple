    With one of the longest coastlines, vast wilderness, world-class cities, and a culture of tolerance and diversity,
    Canada is a natural destination for thousands of international students.
    </p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="./images/cap1.png" alt="icon of graduation cap">
    <p class="pb-3">
    One of the biggest reasons students choose to come to Canada is the quality of a Canadian education. A Canadian degree
    is widely recognized as equal to one from the United States, Australia, or the United Kingdom.
    </p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="./images/shield1.png" alt="icon of lotus type flower">
    <p class="pb-3">
    Canada is one of the safest countries in the world, with a low crime rate. In terms of social progress and development,
    according to Global News, Canada was ranked the second country in the world with the highest quality of life.</p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="./images/snow1.png" alt="icon of lotus type flower">
    <p class="pb-3">
    In Canada, students can pleasantly combine an enriching academic life with diverse and entertaining leisure activities.

    <p class="pb-3">
    English and French are both official languages in Canada and share equal status, but anywhere you choose to go in
    Canada, you can easily survive just by speaking and communicating in English.</p>

                  regional attractions and history. The area’s popularity has increased as a base for visiting the wilderness parks of

                  highly popular Juan de Fuca Marine Trail. Sooke, BC is also famous for its beaches just on the outskirts of neighboring

All of our schools are located in or near the world-famous Rocky Mountains in British Columbia. That means you’ll be surrounded by mountain peaks, rivers, forests, and lakes and you’ll be able to see waterfalls, glaciers, canyons, and wildlife. It is an amazing place to experience nature and outdoor recreation.

              Newfoundland and Labrador is one of the friendliest and safest places in North America. A place where laughter is a
              recurring theme; a place where its people are recognized for their hospitality, warmth, and love of music and culture.
              This is where you may look up to examine a high-rise building, pause to smell the roses, all without the shoving and
              pushing of time-starved city-walkers.

          <p><em>
              Schools throughout the province offer a curriculum recognized and supported by the Provincial Department of Education
              including AP and IB selections.
